Big Field and Particle Simulator
================================

At the moment, this code is meant to run pseudospectral DNS of
Navier-Stokes, using FFTW 3, and to integrate particle trajectories in
the resulting fields.
I'm trying to write it as general as possible, so that it can be
expanded in the future; it remains to be seen how well this will work.
